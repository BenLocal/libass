Please replace the following text with the appropiate information.

**libass version in use?**  
If you encountered the crash on an old version of libass please retest with
current git-master if possible.

**Did you encounter the crash in earlier versions of libass?**
Or did everything work just fine before?

**System you encountered the crash on?**  
OS:  *(\*Linux, Mac, Windows, …)*  
CPU: *(32 or 64Bit AMD/Intel x86, ARM, POWER, …)*

**Sample**
Please provide a sufficient sample to reproduce the crash.

At minimum this will be an excerpt of an ASS file; don't forget to also share
the used Styles not only the Dialogue line. The excerpt should basically be a
fully functional ASS file in itself.

If a special font is required, please attach it.

If the issue is specific to a video file, please try to upload a short cut of it.
Eg MKVToolNix allows you to make a smaller cut from a larger file.


**Log**
If you have logs or a stack trace regarding the issue please include them.

**Anything else**
Feel free to add anything else that may be useful.
